# PowerUtils
**Summary**
-
PowerUtils is a Powershell module put together containing useful utilities. While The majority of it is my own code, if I have ever borrwoed any code, I have noted this in the script files where the code is used.

**Installation**
-
In order to install this module, it is recommended to pull this Git repository to the Global Modules folder location of %systemdrive%:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules.

`Install-Module PowerUtils`

**Loading The Module**
-
As long as the module path is loaded in PATH, you can import the module into PowerShell.

`Import-Module PowerUtils`

**Whats New**
-
See [Releases](https://github.com/mouse-man/PowerUtils/releases) page for details.

**Compatibility**
-
The scripts written have been created and tested on a machine running Windows 10 with PowerShell 5 installed. Where possible, code has been run in lower versions of both Windows and PowerShell. If a specific version is required, then it will be in the code to block it from lower versions. Also, if other PowerShell modules are required, they are noted in the code to prevent it running if not compatible.
